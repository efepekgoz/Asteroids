# Asteroids

Welcome to the **Asteroids** from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev). This project is a hands-on coding exercise designed to reinforce programming fundamentals through a fun and interactive experience. Whether you're practicing loops, conditionals, functions, or working with game physics, the Asteroid Project helps solidify your skills through practical application.

## 🚀 Overview

The Asteroid Project simulates a simplified asteroid avoidance game. Your task is to control a spaceship, avoid incoming asteroids, and survive as long as possible. The game is built to be extendable and is a great way to explore topics like:

- Object-oriented programming
- Game loops and rendering
- Collision detection
- Event handling and input control

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Apply core programming concepts in a visual context
- Understand how game loops and real-time input work
- Practice working with structured codebases
- Extend and refactor code to add new features

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame (or another rendering library depending on implementation)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run

After installing dependencies, launch the game with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Use the arrow keys to move your ship. Avoid the asteroids. Have fun!

## 💡 Suggestions for Extensions

- Add a scoring system
- Include power-ups or weapons
- Implement levels or increasing difficulty
- Add sound effects and background music
